The UseR! workshop on Multivariate analysis using [Additive Bayesian Networks](https://cran.r-project.org/package=abn) is part of the [useR! Conference](https://user2021.r-project.org/) which will take place online, from July 5 to July 9. 

# General information

**When:** July the 7th 2021

**Where:** Online

**Requirements:** Personal laptop. Basic statistics and basic knowledge of [R](https://www.r-project.org/). No prior knowledge about graph theory or Bayesian statistics is needed. Please follow the getting started [checklist](getting_started.md)

**Tutorial instructors:** [Gilles Kratzer](https://gilleskratzer.netlify.com/) & [Reinhard Furrer](https://user.math.uzh.ch/furrer/) & Nicolas Huber


Additive Bayesian Networks (ABN) have been developed to disentangle complex relationships of highly correlated datasets as frequently encountered in risk factor analysis studies. ABN is an efficient approach to sort out direct and indirect relationships among variables which is surprisingly common in systemic epidemiology. After the tutorial, you will run the particular steps within an ABN analysis with real-world data. You will be able to contrast this approach with standard regression (linear, logistic, Poisson regression, and multinomial models) used for classical risk factor analysis. Towards the end, we also cover Bayesian Model Averaging in the context of an ABN, which is useful to assess the validity of the learned model and more advanced inference on the network.


# Learning outcomes

- To understand the basic theory behind structure discovery and Additive Bayesian
Networks modelling
- To learn how to set up and interpret an Additive Bayesian Network model for
multivariate analysis of animal health data using the R package [abn](https://cran.r-project.org/package=abn)
- To consider possible synergies with other R package such as [mcmcabn](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mcmcabn) for further analysis
